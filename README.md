# ParallelSpikeSim (PSS)

ParallelSpikeSim (PSS) is a GPU accelerated spiking neural network simulator. 

PSS is first introduced in [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8714846) (Author: Xueyuan She, Yun Long and Saibal Mukhopadhyay). Since the introduction, some more functions are added to PSS, including:

- Spiking convolutional neural network
- Frequency-dependent STDP
- Process in memory (ReRAM) hardware simulation


If you use PSS in your work, please cite this [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8714846).
